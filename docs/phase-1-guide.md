# Phase 1: Foundation & Setup

## 🎯 Goals for This Phase
- Understand the project structure
- Set up your development environment
- Create the basic skeleton of all services
- Get everything running with Docker

## 📚 Key Concepts You'll Learn

### 1. Full-Stack Architecture
A full-stack application has three main layers:
- **Frontend**: What users see and interact with (like a website)
- **Backend**: The server that handles business logic and data
- **Database**: Where we store all our information

### 2. Microservices vs Monolith
We're building a **microservices** architecture:
- **Monolith**: Everything in one big application
- **Microservices**: Multiple small, focused services that work together

Our services:
- **Frontend Service**: Next.js app for the user interface
- **Backend Service**: NestJS API for authentication and coordination  
- **AI Service**: Python service for research and AI processing
- **Database Services**: PostgreSQL for data, Redis for caching

### 3. Docker Containers
Think of Docker like shipping containers:
- Each service runs in its own "container"
- Containers are isolated but can communicate
- Easy to run the same setup on any computer
- No "it works on my machine" problems!

### 4. API Communication
Services talk to each other through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):
- Like a restaurant menu - defines what you can order
- Uses HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Data usually sent as JSON

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1.1: Install Required Tools

Let's check what you have and install what's missing:

```bash
# Check Node.js (should be 18+)
node --version

# Check Python (should be 3.9+)
python3 --version

# Check Docker
docker --version

# Check Git
git --version
```

If any are missing, I'll help you install them.

### Step 1.2: Create Project Structure

We'll create this folder structure:

```
Project1/
├── README.md                 # Project documentation
├── docker-compose.yml        # Runs all services together
├── .env.example             # Environment variables template
├── .gitignore               # Files to ignore in Git
│
├── frontend/                # Next.js application
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── components/
│   └── ...
│
├── backend/                 # NestJS API server
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── src/
│   ├── prisma/             # Database schema
│   └── ...
│
├── agents/                  # Python AI service
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── agents/
│   └── ...
│
└── docs/                   # Additional documentation
    ├── api.md
    ├── deployment.md
    └── ...
```

### Step 1.3: Environment Variables

Environment variables are like settings for your app:
- Different values for development vs production
- Keep secrets (like API keys) out of your code
- Easy to change without modifying code

Example variables we'll need:
- `DATABASE_URL`: Where to find the database
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret for user sessions

### Step 1.4: Git Setup

Version control tracks changes to your code:
- Save snapshots of your work
- Collaborate with others
- Undo changes if something breaks
- Track what changed when

## 🎯 Phase 1 Deliverables

By the end of this phase, you'll have:

1. ✅ **Development Environment**: All tools installed and working
2. ✅ **Project Structure**: Folders and files organized properly
3. ✅ **Basic Services**: Hello World version of each service
4. ✅ **Docker Setup**: All services running with one command
5. ✅ **Git Repository**: Version control set up and first commit
6. ✅ **Documentation**: Clear setup instructions

## 🧪 Testing Phase 1

We'll know Phase 1 is complete when:
- You can run `docker-compose up` and see all services start
- You can visit the frontend in your browser
- You can call the backend API and get a response
- You can see "Hello World" from the Python service

## 🚨 Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Skipping documentation**: Always document what you build
2. **Not using environment variables**: Never put secrets in code
3. **Inconsistent naming**: Use clear, consistent names for everything
4. **No error handling**: Always plan for things to go wrong
5. **Not testing as you go**: Test each piece before moving on

## 🤔 Questions to Ask Yourself

Before moving to Phase 2:
1. Do I understand what each service does?
2. Can I explain how Docker containers work?
3. Do I know how to check logs when something goes wrong?
4. Am I comfortable with the command line basics?

## 🎉 Ready to Start?

Let me know:
1. Have you reviewed this phase plan?
2. Do you have any questions about the concepts?
3. Are you ready to start setting up your environment?

Once you're ready, we'll start with checking your current setup and installing any missing tools!
